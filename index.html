    Hi my name is Madelyn and this is my web page. I also go by Maddy. I study Journalism and Design at the New School and right now I am coding a website on Atom. I don't really know what I am doing. I am a libra, a cancer moon, and a taurus rising. I like astrology. I also like the color pink. Here - or somewhere on this web page you will find a picture I took out my window.
